# SugarCE Add-ons Repository
Welcome to the SugarCE Add-ons Repository! This new CE add-on repository will allow you more control when creating your listings. As with any change, there will be questions. This FAQ is your guide to helping you get answers, ensuring a smooth transition.

## Q. Why github?
Fork, pull, clone, are all part of every developer’s vernacular. Let’s face it, GitHub has defined how we do open source, community driven development. It enables our community to have far more control--something we are very excited about. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, you walk through the [github bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) to get started quickly. You can also check out the [github guides 'Hello World'](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) project to see the concepts in more detail. 

## Q. What do I need to do as a CE developer to create a listing?
To list your add-on, all you need to do is:
> 1. Fork this repository
> 1. Clone your forked copy so you can work locally
> 1. Update the project’s markdown and listing page
> 1. Submit a pull request

Make sure you are familiar with the [policies and guidelines for listings](CONTRIBUTING.md). Once the pull request comes in, the community managers will simply accept the request and your listing is live.


## Q. Do I upload my .zip file here?
No! This repository should only be used to create a reference to where you ultimately host your code. Of course, you can create your own github repository and host your code and download there!

## Q. I’d like to be involved. How can I help?
Awesome!! One of the reasons we are moving to github is we believe this will enable members who are passionate about open source to be more involved. If you would like to help manage the git repository, drop us a quick email at sugar-forge@sugarcrm.com.

## Q. Is this repository only for CE add-ons?
Yes. SugarCRM will be providing a more complete solution for add-ons that are targeted at Sugar 7 and above. Stay tuned!!

## Q. Is SugarExchange moving to github?
No. We’ll be announcing a separate plan for SugarExchange. Stay tuned!!
